Documenting a vipersoftx attack i suffered


I recently had my Binance wallet drained while trying to withdraw ETH to my account. I spend hours finding the culprit and I found this:

Google Sheets 2.5 Chrome extension, which was sideloaded somehow from a powershell script.

I did my research and I found out it was a ViperSoftX attack which has been documented pretty well in the last 2 years, however it seems none of the documentations are up to date.

Please excuse me as it is my first time making a github post or anything so I might miss some important things but feel free to let me know

the code was in .js containers and i beautified it and put it in txt files. everything here looks like gibberish to me but you can see in "mainjs.txt" the domains of many crypto exchanges

here are some screenshots of what i found
