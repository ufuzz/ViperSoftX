# ViperSoftX
Documenting a vipersoftx attack i suffered


I recently had my Binance wallet drained while trying to withdraw ETH to my account. I spend hours finding the culprit and I found this:

Google Sheets 2.5 Chrome extension, which was sideloaded somehow from a powershell script.

I did my research and I found out it was a ViperSoftX attack which has been documented pretty well in the last 2 years, however it seems none of the documentations are up to date.

Please excuse me as it is my first time making a github post or anything so I might miss some important things but feel free to let me know

in this repo i will add the code from the extension's folder.
